## Commands

### `export`
The [export command](https://github.com/wamphlett/flutterl10nmanager/blob/master/lib/commands/export.dart) looks at you Flutter projects internationalisation directory and builds a single CSV containing all of your localisations as defined in [`intl_messages.arb`](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#appendix-using-the-dart-intl-tools) and all of the corisponding language values from your `intl_<locale>.arb` files.
