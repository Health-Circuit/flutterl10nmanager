# Flutter L10N Manager
A package to help manage multiple languages in a Flutter project

## Commands

### `export`
The [export command](https://github.com/wamphlett/flutterl10nmanager/blob/master/lib/commands/export.dart) looks at you Flutter projects internationalisation directory and builds a single CSV containing all of your localisations as defined in [`intl_messages.arb`](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#appendix-using-the-dart-intl-tools) and all of the corisponding language values from your `intl_<locale>.arb` files.

example usage:
```
flutterl10nmanager export path/to/flutter/l10n/dir -o optional/output/file.csv
```

### `create`
The [create command](https://github.com/wamphlett/flutterl10nmanager/blob/master/lib/commands/create.dart) takes a csv which was generated by the `export` command and creates an internationalisation arb file for each language specifed in the csv.


example usage:
```
flutterl10nmanager create path/to/export.csv -o optional/output/dir
```
